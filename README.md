# AI-Powered Citation Verification

A web app for citation verification.

- App built with [LitServe](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/litserve/) and [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio)
- User enters a claim and evidence and the model predicts a classification: Support, Refute, or Not Enough Information (NEI)
- The [default model](https://huggingface.co/jedick/DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli-scifact-citint) is fine-tuned on two datasets, SciFact and Citation-Integrity
  - See this [ML capstone project](https://github.com/jedick/ML-capstone-project/tree/main/data) for more information
- The app allows selecting alternate models ([BERT](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased) and [pre-trained DeBERTa](https://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli)) that were not fine-tuned

## Running the app

Install the requirements with the `pip install` command below.
Then, run the two `python` commands in different terminals.

```
pip install torch transformers litserve gradio
python app/server.py
python app/app.py
```

App usage:

- Browse to the URL generated by the last command
- Input a claim and evidence ([example](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/multi_nli/viewer/default/train?row=37&views%5B%5D=train))
- Hit "Enter" or press the Submit button to run the inference
- The probabilities predicted by the model are printed in the Classification text box and visualized in the barchart
- Change the model using the dropdown at the top
  - This automatically re-runs the inference using the selected model
