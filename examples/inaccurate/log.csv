"In this way, loc285194 functions as a downstream p53 effector that exerts its anti-proliferative role by binding miR-211 in CRC and miR-23b in GC","We present evidence that loc285194 is a direct target for p53 and functions as a tumor suppressor in part through negative regulation of miR-211. Together, these results suggest that loc285194 is a p53-regulated tumor suppressor, which acts in part through repression of miR-211. Therefore, loc285194 suppresses tumor cell growth not only in vitro but also in vivo, further suggesting that loc285194 is a p53 downstream effector, functioning as a tumor suppressor. Finally, we demonstrate that loc285194 negatively regulates miR-211, which may in part account for loc285194-mediated cell growth inhibition. Together, these results suggest that both loc285194 and miR-211 are associated with the RISC complex through which loc285194 is able to reduce the miR-211 level and vice versa.","REFUTE (CitInt train)"
