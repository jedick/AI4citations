"0-dimensional biomaterials lack inductive properties.","Nanotechnologies are emerging platforms that could be useful in measuring, understanding, and manipulating stem cells. Examples include magnetic nanoparticles and quantum dots for stem cell labeling and in vivo tracking; nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and polyplexes for the intracellular delivery of genes/oligonucleotides and protein/peptides; and engineered nanometer-scale scaffolds for stem cell differentiation and transplantation. This review examines the use of nanotechnologies for stem cell tracking, differentiation, and transplantation. We further discuss their utility and the potential concerns regarding their cytotoxicity.",SciFact
"This high AMP/ATP ratio activates the phosphorylation of AMPK, a master energy sensor within cell, and then pAMPK inhibits mTOR signaling by activating TSC2 and subsequently inhibiting Rheb","When electron transport function is inhibited, the ATP synthase can function in reverse such that it uses ATP generated by glycolysis to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, maintaining membrane potential (Appleby et al., 1999). This latter hypothesis has been questioned as cancer cells have the ability to survive on ATP produced exclusively by glycolysis. The ATP synthase inhibitor, Oligomycin A, diminished TMRE fluorescence in Control-HCT 116 p53−/− cells treated with metformin suggesting that in the presence of metformin, intact cells maintain their mitochondrial membrane potential by reversal of the ATP synthase (Figure 4E). Metformin inhibits cellular proliferation and pro- proliferative signaling via complex I inhibition. It is likely that metformin acts upstream of this site, inhibiting complex I activity while also inhibiting ROS generation.",CitInt
